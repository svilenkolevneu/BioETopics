# BioETopics
# Week 4 prof. Slavov assignment
Problem 1 has 2 versions. v1 was an attempt to do Go enrichment using the online tool panther on the site go amigo but this tool did not return all of the genes searched for. However the go enrichment was still done in 3 different ways different in normaization method. I did not understand the units or the original data so I tried to normalize the protein abundance, and also normalize the go terms. Version 2 was done using gprofiler tool online to sort almost all the genes entered into go terms for biological process. 

Problem 2 used plsregress and a SVD method from wikipedia for partial least squares and total least squares respectivly. the partial least squares method calculated the slope very poorly in every trial of sample size and variance. My attempt with PLS had significanly higher error then the data presented in the class lecure.

Both problems have pdf files with the published script and figures
